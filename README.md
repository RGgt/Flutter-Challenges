[Flutter Challenges](https://rggt.github.io/flutter-challenges/) is a web site for those like me, who prefer learning by actually codding rather than just reading/watching tutorials. That's not to say that tutorials are bad. In fact, I think they are vital in the first phase of learning when everything is new, and you have no idea what to do and how to start. But once I get familiar enough with the topic, I enjoy tackling some interesting challenges that are balanced for my level. And usually, once I complete a challenge, I keep fiddling with the result and see what else is there to learn. 

**Challenges are a great way to learn, as long as they are short enough, lead to something interesting (not to another to-do list app), and are not too hard.**

So, I made this website to publish Flutter challenges and put it on GitHub so anyone can see it and contribute. 
 
 
**If you have alternative solutions to some challenges**,
please contact me and I will create the necessary files (and configuration), or, if you know Jekyll, just add those files yourself and submit pull requests!

Of corse, credit will be given!
