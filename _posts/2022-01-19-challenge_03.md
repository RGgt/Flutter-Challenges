<p>The first technical challenge here is to draw the dialer with the hour and minute marks. Note that there is a gradiant on the dialer, starting from a lighter grey in the top-left, to a slightly darker one on the botom-right.</p>
<p>The second technical challenge is to draw the hours and toggle from roman number to arab numbers when the button is pressed.</p>
